# Language Depot API

An API for Language Depot, written in node.js

This project uses Svelte-Kit (which is replacing Sapper) as the HTTP server serving up API routes.

Until the Svelte-Kit documentation is ready, https://sk-incognito.vercel.app/learn/what-is-sveltekit is the best source for understanding how this works.
